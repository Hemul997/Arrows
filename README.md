# Arrows

This project is test which intended to rate two-coordinate control accuracy. Main test iteration: two pair of arrows draws before user, first pair in the right, second in the left.
In arrows pair, first arrow moves in X-axis, second - Y-axis. Arrows in the left pair moves automatically, in the right - under the impact of user. 
Two-coordinate control accuracy rated by comparing lengths of right and left arrow pairs on same axies.
